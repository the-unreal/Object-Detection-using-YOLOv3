# Object-Detection-using-YOLOv3

Run the object_detection_yolov3.py file for real time object detection.

The program has been referrenced and edited from the [Keras implementation of YOLOv3 by experiencor].
The weights were downloaded and were converted to a Keras model in Weights_to_Model_converter.ipynb. The DarkNet architecture was used to convert the weights to a model.
The program was run on Google colab.
